Sliding Window PAtterns:-
    - Pattern 1:- Content window (eg: sum of consecutive element equal to target)

    - Pattern 2:- Longest subarray(for array problem)/substring(for string problem), where we have a condition
	    - subarray:- consecutive elements in an array
        - Methods:
            - Brute force:- Generate all subarray
            - Better:- Sliding window with shrinking TC:- O(N (for moving right pointer) + N (for shrinking))
            - Optimal:- TC:- O(N) -- instead of keep shrinking till a valid window, we shrink until the current max length i.e just 1 time (so just an "if" condition needed instead of "while").

    - Pattern 3:- No. of subarrays where <condition>
        - Eg:- Number of subarray with sum = k

        - Method:
            - Break it down into 2 parts:
                - x = no. of subarray where sum <=k
                - y = no. of subarray where sum <=k-1
                - So, final answer will be "x - y"
    
    - Pattern 4:- Shortest/Minimum window where <condition>
        - Method:-
            - Expand until you get a valid window
            - Once you get a valid window:
                - Keep shrinking it until it remain a valid window and the minimum subarray store it as an answer.
