"""
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
"""

#==================================================
"""
ALGORITHM:
- traverse through the string
    - if found the open bracket , put it in the stack
    - if found the closing bracket, check the top of the stack for the corresponding opening bracket of it:-
        - if top has corresponding opening bracket
            - pop it from the top of the stack
        - if top doesn't have corresponding closing bracket
            - return false.

- After full traversal, check the stack:
    - if empty:
        - return true
    - if not empty, means there is a opening bracket whose corresponding closing bracket is not present in the string
        - return false
